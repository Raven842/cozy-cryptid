This is my personal website, home to my blog music I like art I've made and some I've seen and all manor of quirky and fun things.

Below this line is my personal to do list, feel free to read further to get a feel of how the site has progressed over time, though there won't be a huge ammount of detail as this is
mostly a personal project so a lot of the details are stored in my brain.
